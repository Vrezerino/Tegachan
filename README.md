## TegaChan (Next.js/MongoDB)

TegaChan is an imageboard type discussion forum. It features dynamic app routing within a dashboard, and styles mostly employ Tailwind CSS.

Thread starter posts are sorted by bump order, and new threads and replies that can be posted with a form, get validated in the middleware (between request and response).

To run the project on your own computer, install Git CLI, Node.js, and npm (Node package manager).

```
cd C:\ExamplePath

npm install
npm run dev
